# Google Login Testing Checklist

## Ignore These Errors âœ…
The `NET::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors you're seeing are **NOT related to your Google login**. These are:
- Google Play Store logging requests blocked by ad blockers
- Common in Chrome extensions/web apps
- Safe to ignore - they don't affect OAuth functionality

## Test the Google Login Flow

### Step 1: Load the Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `build` folder
5. **Copy your Extension ID** (important for next step)

### Step 2: Configure Google OAuth (CRITICAL)
ðŸš¨ **This step is required for Google login to work:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**
3. Find your OAuth2 client: `1014179036736-d8et6ht2jf4kf9flcol0uv0ktv33v5fh`
4. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
5. In **"Authorized redirect URIs"** section:
   - Click **"ADD URI"**
   - Add: `https://[YOUR-EXTENSION-ID].chromiumapp.org/`
   - Replace `[YOUR-EXTENSION-ID]` with the actual ID from Step 1
   - Example: `https://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.chromiumapp.org/`
6. Click **"SAVE"**

### Step 3: Test Google Login
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Side panel opens with login form
3. Click **"Continue with Google"** button
4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Google OAuth popup opens
   - You can sign in and grant permissions
   - Popup closes automatically
   - You're logged into the extension dashboard

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and look for these success messages:
```
âœ… Extension redirect URL: https://[your-id].chromiumapp.org/
âœ… Successfully obtained token via getAuthToken
âœ… Google user info: {email: "...", name: "..."}
âœ… Backend response status: 200
âœ… Google login successful!
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Authorization page could not be loaded"
**Cause:** Redirect URI not added to Google Cloud Console
**Fix:** Complete Step 2 above

### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch"
**Cause:** Extension ID in Google Console doesn't match actual extension ID
**Fix:** 
1. Double-check your extension ID from `chrome://extensions/`
2. Update the redirect URI in Google Console with correct ID

### Issue: "access_blocked: This app is blocked"
**Cause:** Your email isn't added as a test user
**Fix:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ **OAuth consent screen**
2. Scroll to **"Test users"**
3. Add your email address
4. Save changes

### Issue: Extension ID keeps changing
**Cause:** Loading unpacked extensions generates new IDs each time
**Solution for development:**
1. Always use the same folder (`build`)
2. Don't delete and re-add the extension
3. Just click "Reload" button instead

## What Should Work Now

After completing Step 2 (adding redirect URI):

âœ… **Google login button appears** with proper styling
âœ… **OAuth popup opens** when clicked
âœ… **User can authenticate** and grant permissions
âœ… **Token is received** and sent to backend
âœ… **User data is saved** to Chrome storage
âœ… **Dashboard loads** with user logged in
âœ… **Persistent login** - user stays logged in between sessions

## Backend Requirements

Make sure your Django backend is running:
```bash
# In your backend directory
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

The `/api/users/google-signup` endpoint should be accessible.

## Final Verification

After setup, the complete flow should be:
1. Click "Continue with Google" â†’ 2. OAuth popup â†’ 3. Grant permissions â†’ 4. Popup closes â†’ 5. Dashboard appears â†’ 6. User logged in âœ…

Let me know your Extension ID and I can help verify the redirect URI format!
